**Project**: `instakarm`
**Last Human Commit**: `No human commits found`
**Assessment Date**: `2025-10-17`

**Summary of Style Guide Adherence**:
Following a detailed code review and refactoring session, the project's adherence to the style guide has significantly improved. The architecture remains solid, and the codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable. All issues reported by `dart analyze` have been resolved, and key components like repositories and providers are now well-documented. The centralization of theme colors and removal of hardcoded values have enhanced consistency. The primary remaining weakness is the lack of comprehensive documentation across all widgets and UI components.

**Scores (1-5, 5 is best)**:
- Naming Conventions: 5
- Documentation: 4
- Structure & Patterns: 5
- Readability: 5

**Opportunities for Improvement**:
- **Complete Widget Documentation**: Add Dartdoc comments to all public widgets to explain their purpose, parameters, and usage.
- **Expand Unit and Widget Testing**: Increase test coverage to ensure long-term stability and reliability of the application.
- **Implement a Logging Framework**: Replace all remaining instances of `debugPrint` with a more robust logging solution to improve debugging capabilities in production.

**Dart Analyze Output**:
```
No issues found!
